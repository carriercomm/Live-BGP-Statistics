Download Live BGP Statistics zip (or git clone) from GitHub and extract it to a web accessible folder.

Create a MySQL database and import the db_schema.sql to create the system's tables.

Copy includes/config.php.dist to includes/config.php and edit it appropriately.

Make sure you install phpseclib http://phpseclib.sourceforge.net/ on your PHP's include path.
It's needed for SSH2 access to MikroTik routers. Version 0.1.0 is known to work ok.

Also make sure you have Memcached installed and running on 127.0.0.1:11211

Before using the system for the first time you should sync all WiND data to our database.
Via shell run the following command:

$ php /path/to/live-bgp-statistics/wind_import.php

This will connect to the configured WiND database (on config.php) and it will fetch all the nodes from it to our database.
Depending on the size of the WiND database and how fast its server is, this may take up to several hours.

You should run wind_import.php periodically to fetch any newly added nodes.
At the moment each run will fetch everything from scratch so use it carefully as it will first truncate the whole nodes table and then populate it from the begginning.


This system will use the registered routers of BGP Looking Glass NG to connect to them periodically and fetch the BGP tables.
If you have configured enough routers on BGP Looking Glass you may run the bgpcollect.php script to start collecting data.

Via shell run the following command to start the bgpcollect.php script

$ screen -dmS stats /usr/bin/php /path/to/live-bgp-statistics/bgpcollect.php

It will start looping through all configured routers fetching their BGP tables.
At any time you can close the terminal. The script will continue to run in the background indefinitely.
If you wish to see the output of the script at a later time reconnect to the terminal and run:

$ screen -r -d stats


Currently the bgpcollect.php script supports Quagga and MikroTik Routers.
For Quagga read only telnet access to the bgpd daemon is required.
For MikroTik read only ssh access to the router is required.
