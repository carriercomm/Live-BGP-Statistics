Live BGP Statistics
                                         
This system is complementary to PHP Looking Glass NG (read below for info). It cannot work on its own.
It's intended to be used for troubleshooting and visualization of Wireless Community Networks using BGP for their backbone routing.
It assumes that each wireless node is it's own AS (Autonomous System).
It's not tested on the full internet BGP table. Probably it won't work properly since it's not optimized for such large BGP tables.

It uses the routers database from PHP Looking Glass NG to connect to each router and periodically fetch the whole BGP routing table.
It then calculates all the BGP Peers for each AS on the network and shows them in easy to interpret representation.
Currently only Quagga and Mikrotik routers are supported.

Features:

-Show each detected AS' BGP Peers in an easy to read list
-Full BGP Prefixes List with filters by AS Number and Prefix
-BGP Prepends detection with filters by AS Number
-Full BGP Peers list with filters by AS Number
-BGP Event Log with all events (New/Updated/Deleted Peers/Prefixes/Prepends, plus other events) with filters by AS Number and Prefix
-Invalid Prefix Advertisments list with all the ASes that advertised unssigned or invalid prefixes to the network. This relies heavily on WiND's database to work  
-Live BGP Map with all the ASes and their peers

Requirements:

PHP Looking Glass NG https://github.com/Cha0sgr/BGP-Looking-Glass-NG
WiND https://github.com/wind-project/wind
Tested on Ubuntu and Fedora. It should work just fine on any other distro as well.
PHP 5.2+
MySQL 5.1+
Memcached
phpseclib ://phpseclib.sourceforge.net/
Shell Access (to run the bgpcollect.php script)
GNU screen (to keep running the bgpcollect.php script and still have access to its output for troubleshooting)
